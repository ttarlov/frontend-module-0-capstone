<h2>Chapter 2 (Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays)</h2>

<h3>How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?</h3>
<i>The variable is declared by using a var "keyword". After the variable is declared and given a name you need to assign it a value. This is done via an assignment operator ( the equals sign ).</i>  


<h3>There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.</h3>

<i><ul>
    <li><b>Numeric</b> - Just as it sounds. This data type handles numbers. Especially numbers that might be involved in mathematical calculations.
    <li><b>String</b> - This of this as a "content" data type. It consists of letters and other characters. Note that string data type is always placed in quotes (single or double). Also note that you can use HTML markup on the <b>string</b> data type.
    <li><b>Boolean</b>- More abstract but very useful. It carries two possible values: true or false. This is helpful when determining what part of a script should run. </i>
    </ul>
