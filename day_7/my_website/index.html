<div class="greeting">
  <p>My name is Taras. I am 33 years old. I am originally from Russia. I moved to the United States in 2003 when I
    was 17 years old to attend a boarding school. After graduating highschool I went to college where I received my bachelors degree in business administration and a minor in psychology.
    Since college I have worked numerous sales jobs and after about 8 years I am ready for a new challenge. </p>

<p>I have a lot of hobbies, actually too many and not enough time to enjoy them. One hobby that I have had since I was a little kid is my love for cars and motorcycles. Over the year I have built a number of vehicles.
  Only one of them stuck around for longer than a year or so. Check out <a href="my-projects.html"> my projects</a> page for pictures.</p>
